# Seimutils
An open-source Python toolkit designed to assist researchers and practitioners in the field of seismology. It provides a set of efficient and user-friendly functions for analyzing seismic data streamlining the workflow for tasks such as visualization, data manipulation, and analysis, enhancing productivity and facilitating scientific discovery.

It is structured in two main sections:
- `data.Ã¨y`, a variety of functions tailored for managing and analyzing earthquake-related data. This includes general tools for data handling, such as importing and organizing earthquake catalogs, and functionalities for basic data analysis and visualization. The focus is on providing a solid foundation for data-centric tasks in seismology.

- `waveforms.py`, dedicated to the processing and analysis of earthquake waveforms. It offers a suite of tools for waveform manipulation, enabling users to perform both basic and advanced waveform analyses. This section is designed to assist in the interpretation and understanding of seismic data through effective waveform processing techniques.
